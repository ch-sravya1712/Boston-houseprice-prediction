# Boston-houseprice-prediction & deployement using FLASK
We performed Boston house price predictions leveraging twelve regression models. Our implementation was deployed using Flask.

## Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language used for the project.

Flask (Web Framework): Used to build the web application.

scikit-learn (Machine Learning Library): Utilized for implementing machine learning models for price prediction.

HTML/CSS (Frontend): Responsible for creating the user interface.

## Features
Input Fields: Users can input key features such as crime rate, average number of rooms, etc.

Prediction: The system predicts the median housing cost based on the provided input.

User-Friendly Interface: The web interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly.
